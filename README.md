# python_challenge
My name is Owen Pollard. In this challenge, I analyzed two different data sets.
PyBank is a data set containing hypothetical profits/losses. I created a code that prints total months, average change in P&L, and greatest increase/decrease in P&L.
PyPoll is a data set where I scripted a code that counted total votes for each candidate as well as the overall amount of votes. I also declared who the winner is!
